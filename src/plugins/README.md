# Plugins

This directory is for registering global plugins that extend the functionality of your Vue application. 

## Usage

Plugins can be added to the application by importing them in the `index.ts` file and using the `app.use()` method. This allows you to utilize various features and functionalities provided by the plugins throughout your application.

For example, Vuetify is registered here to provide UI components and styles. You can add more plugins as needed to enhance your application.
