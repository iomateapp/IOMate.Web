# Styles

This directory is for configuring the styles of the application. It includes SASS variables and Vuetify overwrites to customize the appearance of components and layouts. 

Make sure to organize your styles in a way that promotes reusability and maintainability. You can create additional SASS files as needed to manage styles for specific components or pages.
